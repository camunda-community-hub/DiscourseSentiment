# Discourse Topic Sentiment Analysis 
## This service allows you to choose any Discourse topic and run a complete sentiment Analysis on it based on all the posts referencing that topic

### About this project

While this service may seem small, it is in fact, mighty. This project can be used across departments such as engineering and product management, enabling Camunda team members to make data driven decisions based on conversations that are happening in real-time in our community. This project is also beneficial to our engineering team in that it may be useful for planning purposes, allowing for the querying of data to prioritize features according to community feedback or interest. This may save time for the team[s] in question, as they will be able to run a query against the forums to see if a feature is requested often, or if a bug is recurring, and if so, triage it accordingly.

### Using this project

Currently, this project is a Proof of Concept. @davidgs created the initial [Letter to Santa](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/letter-to-santa) project which is the backbone for this project. We use the [Discourse Data Plugin](https://meta.discourse.org/t/data-explorer-plugin/32566) to define and store queries. @celanthe approached him with the idea of running sentiment analysis on a forum topic, and it grew into the project you see here.
